            Idea Generation and data processing: I wanted to use interactions to
            show change in termperature over time. First I created some ideas of
            how I wanted to do that, and decided an interesting layor would be
            to compare this to fossil fuel emissions. I found the right data and
            from there decided what I could implement.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Data Processing and Design: I had to make a lot of edits to the data
            throughout the course of the visualization making. I mostly made all
            the edits using javascript, but some were made in excel to the
            original file. I had to reshape the data and find global averages,
            combining all the information for each country. For design, It was a
            lot of trial and error and learning new things. I tried to
            originally implement both the animations for the line chart and the
            heatmap in vegalite, which proved to be unsuccessful so I moved to
            d3. This was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be and I
            think I learned a lot about visualizations, d3, and problem solving
            in the process. I also made the area chart and the stacked area
            chart with brushing and linking based off our class example.
          </p>

        <li>
          I also helped with the update selection for the bar chart on the C02
          page. I am not sure if the technique I used was the perfect way of
          doing it, but it worked!

      <h4>Page 2: Carbon Dioxide Emissions</h4>
      <p>Members: Le Lyu, Peiyu Zhong</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Idea Generation and data processing: we want to make two
            functionalities, meaning two kinds of User Interactions (UIs), in
            this web page. The first UI consists of a search box and a bar
            chart, which allows the user to search for a country and compare its
            CO2 output to the world's average. The second UI consists of a map
            and a bar chart, which allows the user to click a country on the map
            and customize a comparison list. A clear order button is added to
            clear the bars and scales in the second bar chart in case it gets
            too messy. We used the data from data.world which has 20+ categories
            of data and from late 18th century all the way up to 2014. Before
            using it, I (Le) downloaded it and opened in numbers, then manually
            deleted all the data categories that I don't need and only kept the
            data for the year 2014. By the end of my data processing, the csv
            file contains 171 lines of four different data categories: year,
            country name, the countries' CO2 output in 2014, and the overall CO2
            output in the world.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Implementation: the tool used for the most is d3.js. For the first
            UI, I (Le) followed through a vedio on Youtube and read
            documentations in order to implement a search box. Inside the search
            box, whenever a type event is triggered, the (precomputed) search
            items (cards) that include the input values are displayed. By
            default and when the input is empty, the cards are hidden. Whenever
            the type events are present, the cards get displayed. Then, there
            are event listeners to the cards, and the cursor and background
            color are changed to prompt the user to click a card. When the click
            event happens, d3 will open the data, filter it based on the name of
            the country, and pass the filtered data to the render barchart
            function. Then the barchart gets generated. For the second UI,
            inspired by the third miniproject, I (Peiyu) downloaded the world
            and use d3 to implement it. Because bar-chart has a great advantage
            when comparing different objects, we thought of using bar-chart to
            compare the CO2 emissions of different countries. When the user
            clicks on a country, the icon will form a bar representing that
            country's CO2 emissions in 2014. And the height of each bar will be
            adjusted according to the maximum value existed in the graph.
            Besides, we also created a "Clear Order" button, which allows users
            to clear all the existed data. In other words, the chart will be
            reinitialized.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Improvements made: we made changes on a lot of the places. At first
            we did not come up with the world map in d3 so we chose vegalite,
            but we then changed back into d3. Second, in the prototype, the
            search box cards (search items) are displayed first by default,
            taking a lot of the space. But its logic is changed so that the
            functionality is more clean. Third, we did not have a good country
            comparision visualization in the prototype, so we added the
            customizable bar chart given output from the click events on the
            map.

        <h4>Natural Disasters</h4>
        <p>Members: Ashna Ramaswamy</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Idea Generation and data processing: I originally wanted to create
              a line chart showing the impact of climate change on changes in
              glacial mass. I found data and tried to use Vega-lite to create a
              linked chart with a brushing feature, however the data was not
              valuable enough for the story. Instead, I decided to search for
              data related to disasters to break down how the frequency and
              types of natural disasters have changed over time. I also created the story board for the low-fidelity prototype. The datasets were difficult to work with at first since Vega-lite needed specific formats, so I tried a lot of conversions through Github and ultimately used a csv file through d3.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Implementation: I originally used Vega-lite to create a line and
              bar chart that were linked together showing the average mass of
              glaciers over time and the number of observations. The chart had a
              brushing feature to see the number of observations in the bar
              chart corresponding to the area brushed of the line chart. Since
              this wasn't valuable, I switched to a stacked bar chart with a
              different data set, which includes natural disasters over the
              years grouped by category.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Improvements: I added a zoom feature to the stacked bar chart to
              compare the frequency of natural disasters in adjacent years. I attempted to add a tooltip based on lab 4, but the position of the tooltip stayed in the bottom left, underneath the chart, and the position would not update upon mouseover. Furthermore, the data wouldn't display. I wasn't sure how to improve this, so I abandoned the tooltip.
